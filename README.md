# openGL-BF-Wrappers
Beginner Friendly wrappers for openGL. Basic Shader and Texture files to help get running openGL. These help with creating/setting Fragment and VertexShaders within a shader class. The Texture class helps load textures via binding it to a group texture that loads it as one merged texture. Optionally the user can load singular textures as well.
